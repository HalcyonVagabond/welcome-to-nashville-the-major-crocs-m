Welcome to Nashville: Build an itinerary for a day trip to Music City
In this app users can search for four different things to do/visit in Nashville:

parks -- using the Nashville Metro Gov API
public art collections -- using Nashville Metro Gov API
restaurants -- using the Zomato API
concerts -- using the Ticketmaster API
You will be utilizing all of the skills and concepts that you've learned up to this point in the course.

Itinerary Builder
When the user searches for any of the four categories of things to do, the results should be listed in the DOM. Each result item should have an affordance to add the item to the current itinerary. Use your awesome new skills to select the text of the search result ( ie "John Mellencamp at the Ryman" ) and add it to the itinerary list. See the wireframe below for a visual cue for how this might look.

Professional Requirements
Only one itinerary needs to exist at a time. If a user selects an item to add to the itinerary, and an item already exists for that category in the itinerary, then you will need to update the corresponding itinerary item in the DOM with the new data.
All teammates must be using http-server during development. json-server should only be used if you have time to work on the stretch goal (see below).
Each teammate is responsible for one API module. If your group has five members, one person is responsible for the module that interacts with the DOM and the data from the API modules. In a four-person team, the team will decide how to handle the development of that module.
The README for your project should include instructions on how another person can download and run the application. PRO TIP: Don't wait until the very end to create the README. Readme Cheatsheet
DO NOT FORGET to use a .gitignore file to keep git from tracking .DS_Store, your API Keys, and, if necessary, API directory (stretch goal).
CSS for structure is part of MVP. CSS for style (animations, colors, fonts) is secondary. Do not add any additional visual enhancements until you have a fully functional app.
The goal of every member of the team is to implement functionality with JavaScript.

Notes about the APIs
Ticketmaster API
The Ticketmaster API requires an apikey to be included in the url.

For example:

const concertApi = {
  searchForQueen() {
    return fetch("http://app.ticketmaster.com/discovery/v1/events.json?keyword=Queen&apikey=__YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__")
      .then(response => response.json());
  }
};
Zomato API
Here's an example fetch to search restuarants in Nashville.

1138 is the id for the city of Nashville
entity_type must be set to city
Your API key must be added as an apikey query string parameter
return fetch("https://developers.zomato.com/api/v2.1/search?entity_id=1138&entity_type=city&start=first&sort=rating&apikey=__YOUR_API_KEY_HERE__")
    .then(r => r.json())
Nashville Metro Open Data API
This API does not require an API key.

Keeping track of API Keys
NEVER store API Keys in Github!!!

You will need to a separate JavaScript module with consts to store your API Keys. The module's filename should be added to your .gitignore to prevent if from being added to your git repo.

Stretch Goal
Persist your itinerary with json-server. You only need to have a single itinerary. If the user selects a different park, restaurant, etc, use a PUT to update the itinerary with the new data.

To start you off, here's an example of what the itinerary in your API might look like in your database once it's created by the user.

{
  "itinerary":
      {
        "id": 1,
        "park": "Centennial Park",
        "restaurant": "Princeâ€™s Hot Chicken",
        "meetup": "Meeple Mountain Board Game Night",
        "concert": "John Mellencamp at the Ryman"
      }
}
Stretchier Goals
Add a "more info" link to each of the Public Art search result entries. This link should open a new tab. Use the URL from the page_link property as the link's href.

Stretchiest Goals
Add an affordance to finalize an itinerary, and start a new one.
Add ability to view one or all of the itineraries
Instead of displaying all the search fields, search results, and itinerary list at the same time, add a nav bar or other feature(s) for hiding/showing what the user wants to view
